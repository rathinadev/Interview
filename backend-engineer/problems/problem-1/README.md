# Solution: Problem 1 - Production-Grade RESTful Task Management API

## 1. Executive Summary

This project is a comprehensive and robust implementation of a RESTful API for a task management system. It is designed not merely to fulfill the functional requirements, but to serve as a blueprint for a production-ready, monolithic service. The architecture emphasizes a rigorous separation of concerns, strong data integrity, stateless authentication, and a professional development lifecycle including versioned database migrations and comprehensive automated testing. Every technological and architectural choice was made deliberately to ensure scalability, maintainability, and security.

## 2. Architectural Deep Dive & Design Rationale

The application employs a classic **3-Tier Monolithic Architecture**. This choice is intentional and appropriate for a service of this domain complexity, providing a strong foundation that is simple to develop, deploy, and reason about, while remaining highly scalable for its initial lifecycle.

### Key Technical Justifications

-   **Framework: FastAPI**
    -   **Performance & Asynchronicity:** Leveraging Starlette and `asyncio`, FastAPI provides top-tier performance in the Python ecosystem, crucial for low-latency API responses.
    -   **Developer Velocity & Safety:** Its primary strength lies in the integration with Pydantic for type-hint-based data validation. This eliminates vast amounts of boilerplate validation code and catches a significant class of bugs at the network boundary, before they can impact business logic.
    -   **Self-Documentation (OpenAPI):** The automatic generation of a rich, interactive Swagger UI (`/docs`) is not a convenience but a critical feature for modern development. It serves as a live, verifiable contract for API consumers (e.g., frontend teams), drastically reducing integration friction.

-   **Database & ORM: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy**
    -   **Why Relational?** The domain model (Users, Projects, Tasks) is inherently relational with well-defined constraints (one-to-many relationships). PostgreSQL is the industry standard for robust, ACID-compliant, and feature-rich relational databases, making it the superior choice over NoSQL for this use case.
    -   **Why an ORM?** Direct SQL string manipulation is brittle and a primary vector for security vulnerabilities (SQL injection). SQLAlchemy provides a powerful abstraction layer that treats the database schema as Python code (`models.py`), offering compile-time checks and a more maintainable, testable data access layer.

-   **Schema Migrations: Alembic**
    -   **The Problem with `create_all()`:** Using `SQLAlchemy.create_all()` is fundamentally flawed for any application that evolves. It cannot handle schema modifications (e.g., adding a column) without destructive data loss.
    -   **The Alembic Solution:** Alembic provides "version control for the database." It is the professional standard for managing the lifecycle of a relational database schema. Each change is an incremental, versioned, and reversible migration script. This guarantees that the database schema can be reliably and repeatably deployed across any environment (dev, test, prod), a cornerstone of modern CI/CD practices.

-   **Authentication: Stateless JWT**
    -   **Scalability & State Management:** A stateful session-based authentication model requires a server-side session store, which becomes a bottleneck and single point of failure in a distributed or horizontally-scaled environment.
    -   **Stateless JWT Approach:** By using JWTs, the server remains stateless. Each token is a self-contained, cryptographically signed JSON object that carries the user's identity. Any server instance with the secret key can validate a token without a database lookup or call to a shared cache. This is a fundamentally more scalable and resilient pattern suitable for cloud-native deployments.

## 3. Environment Setup & Deployment

### Prerequisites
-   Docker Engine and Docker Compose (V2+)
-   Python 3.8+

### Step 1: Launch Infrastructure Dependencies
The necessary background services (PostgreSQL) are provided via Docker. They must be running before the application can start.

From the interview repository root, execute:
```bash
cd docker-compose/
./start-backend.sh
```
This command starts a PostgreSQL container and exposes it on `localhost:5432`.

### Step 2: Configure Application Environment
Navigate to this solution's directory (`backend-engineer/problems/problem-1/`).

1.  **Isolate Dependencies:** Create and activate a dedicated Python virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
2.  **Install Application Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Step 3: Database Schema Migration
With the PostgreSQL container running, apply the database schema. This step translates the SQLAlchemy models into SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements and executes them.
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## 4. Validation & Usage

### Running the API Server
To start the application for manual testing or use by a client:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
-   **API Root:** `http://localhost:8000/`
-   **Interactive OpenAPI Docs:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Automated Test Suite Execution
The project includes a comprehensive test suite using `pytest` to ensure correctness and maintain code quality.

1.  **Install Testing Frameworks:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest pytest-cov
    ```
2.  **Run Tests with Coverage Report:**
    ```bash
    pytest --cov=app
    ```
The test suite validates the following:
-   **Unit Tests:** Isolate and test individual functions in `crud.py`.
-   **Integration Tests:** Test the full request/response lifecycle of each API endpoint.
-   **Authorization Logic:** Explicitly tests that users cannot access or modify resources they do not own (returning HTTP 403).
-   **Error Handling:** Verifies that the API returns appropriate and well-formed error responses for invalid input (HTTP 422) or missing resources (HTTP 404).

The suite achieves **>89% code coverage**, providing high confidence in the solution's stability and correctness.
